# Apollo 13
### A simple rocket game made with Python and `tkinter`. 

This game has no complicated features and the code is fairly easy to understand. The goal is to beat your high score and to survive as long as possible by avoiding your Saturn V rocket from crashing onto the meteorites. The rocket accelerates as you play, and there's a feature to enter 'hyper-speed'. It's called Apollo 13.
