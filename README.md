# Apollo 13
### A simple rocket game made with Python and `tkinter`. 

The game has no complicated features and the code is fairly easy to understand. The goal is to beat your high score and to survive as long as possible by avoiding your Saturn V rocket from crashing onto the meteorites. The rocket accelerates as you play, and there's a feature to enter hyper-speed. (The controls are just the arrows on your keyboard. Press up to activate hyper-speed, down to deactivate, space-bar to stand 'still' and left and right for steering.)

The code could easily be written in a smaller amount of lines and there are probably a lot of options to make the program run more smoothly, but I am too lazy to work on it myself since it is an old project and I don't really mind because it is such a simple script. But feel free to edit and use it yourself!
Enjoy!
